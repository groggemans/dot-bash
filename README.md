# dot-bash
My bash configuration

Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own bash configuration!

*My main shell is zsh, this is only a backup config.*

## Install
This bash config is available as [Ellipsis][Ellipsis] package. It is highly
recommended to use Ellipsis for installation, although manual installation is
also supported.

#### Ellipsis
``` shell
    ellipsis install groggemans/dot-bash
```

#### Manual
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/groggemans/dot-bash ~/.bash
    ln -s ~/.bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
    ln -s ~/.bash/profile ~/.profile
    ln -s ~/.bash/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
    ln -s ~/.bash/bash_logout ~/.bash_logout
```
